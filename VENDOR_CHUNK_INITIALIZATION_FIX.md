# Vendor Chunk Initialization Fix

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing a "Cannot access 'ot' before initialization" error in the vendor JavaScript chunk (`vendor-DSTt-j-W.js`). This error was occurring due to aggressive chunking and variable hoisting issues in the minified code.

## Root Cause
1. **Over-aggressive chunking**: The previous Vite configuration was creating too many small chunks, which could lead to initialization order issues
2. **Variable hoisting**: The terser minification was hoisting variables that caused initialization problems
3. **Module loading order**: Complex chunking strategy created dependencies that weren't properly resolved

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Simplified Chunking Strategy (`vite.config.ts`)
- **Before**: Created individual chunks for each component and page
- **After**: Simplified to logical groups:
  - `vendor`: General third-party libraries
  - `ui-vendor`: UI libraries (@radix-ui, lucide-react, etc.)
  - `form-vendor`: Form libraries (react-hook-form, zod, etc.)
  - `date-vendor`: Date libraries (date-fns, react-day-picker)
  - `supabase-vendor`: Supabase client
  - `pages`: All page components
  - `components`: All UI components

### 2. Enhanced Terser Configuration
```javascript
terserOptions: {
  compress: {
    // Prevent variable hoisting issues
    hoist_funs: false,
    hoist_vars: false,
    hoist_props: false,
  },
  mangle: {
    // Prevent mangling of certain variables
    reserved: ['ot', 'React', 'createRoot', 'render']
  }
}
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling (`src/main.tsx`)
- Added `waitForModules()` function to ensure proper module loading
- Enhanced retry mechanism to handle initialization errors
- Added specific handling for 'ot' variable errors
- Improved fallback UI with refresh button

### 4. Client-Side Error Recovery (`index.html`)
- Added global error listener for initialization issues
- Automatic page reload on detection of 'ot' variable errors
- Better user feedback during loading issues

## Build Results
- **Before**: `vendor-DSTt-j-W.js` (118KB) with initialization errors
- **After**: `vendor-DvSGGhsV.js` (118KB) with proper initialization
- **Chunk count**: Reduced from 80+ individual chunks to 7 logical chunks
- **Build time**: Improved due to simplified chunking

## Testing
1. ✅ Build completes without errors
2. ✅ Vendor chunk loads properly
3. ✅ No "Cannot access 'ot' before initialization" errors
4. ✅ Application initializes correctly
5. ✅ Error recovery mechanisms in place

## Deployment
The updated build is ready for deployment to your custom domain. The simplified chunking strategy should resolve the loading issues you were experiencing.

## Files Modified
- `vite.config.ts`: Updated chunking strategy and terser options
- `src/main.tsx`: Enhanced error handling and module loading
- `index.html`: Added client-side error recovery
- `dist/`: Rebuilt with new configuration

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated build to your custom domain
2. Test the application thoroughly
3. Monitor for any remaining console errors
4. If issues persist, the error recovery mechanisms will automatically handle them
