# 🎉 Domain Setup Complete for theglocal.in

## ✅ What I've Fixed

Your project is now properly configured for domain deployment. Here's what I've done:

### 1. Fixed Vite Configuration
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to use domain paths in production
- Configured base URL to use `https://theglocal.in/` for production builds
- Updated CSP (Content Security Policy) to allow domain connections

### 2. Created Deployment Package
- Built the project with domain-specific configuration
- Created `theglocal-domain-deploy.zip` with all necessary files
- Added `.htaccess` for Apache servers
- Added `web.config` for IIS servers

### 3. Generated Files
- ✅ `dist/index.html` - Main application with domain paths
- ✅ `dist/js/` - JavaScript bundles with domain URLs
- ✅ `dist/css/` - Stylesheets
- ✅ `dist/.htaccess` - Apache configuration
- ✅ `dist/web.config` - IIS configuration
- ✅ `theglocal-domain-deploy.zip` - Deployment package

## 🚀 Next Steps to Get Your Domain Working

### Step 1: Upload Files to Web Server
1. Extract `theglocal-domain-deploy.zip`
2. Upload all contents of the `dist/` folder to your web server's root directory
3. Ensure file permissions are correct (644 for files, 755 for directories)

### Step 2: Configure DNS in GoDaddy
1. Log into your GoDaddy account
2. Go to "My Products" → "Domains"
3. Click on `theglocal.in`
4. Go to "DNS" tab
5. Add/Update these records:

**A Record:**
- Name: `@` (or leave blank)
- Value: Your web server's IP address
- TTL: 600

**CNAME Record:**
- Name: `www`
- Value: `theglocal.in`
- TTL: 600

### Step 3: Install SSL Certificate
1. Install SSL certificate for `https://theglocal.in`
2. Use Let's Encrypt (free) or purchase from GoDaddy
3. Configure HTTPS redirect

### Step 4: Test Your Site
1. Wait for DNS propagation (can take 24-48 hours)
2. Visit `https://theglocal.in`
3. Check that all assets load correctly
4. Test navigation and functionality
