## üöÄ Production Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Switch to Live Stripe Keys

1. **Get Live Keys from Stripe Dashboard**:
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí API Keys
   - Copy the live publishable key (`pk_live_...`)
   - Copy the live secret key (`sk_live_...`)

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Update .env file
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   ```

3. **Update Supabase Secrets**:
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Production Webhooks

1. **Create Webhook Endpoint**:
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Click "Add endpoint"
   - URL: `https://your-project-ref.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
   - Select events:
     - `checkout.session.completed`
     - `invoice.paid`
     - `invoice.payment_failed`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`

2. **Get Webhook Signing Secret**:
   - Copy the webhook signing secret (`whsec_...`)
   - Update environment variables:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```

### Step 3: Create Live Products and Prices

1. **Create Products in Stripe Dashboard**:
   - Go to Products ‚Üí Add Product
   - Create "Premium Subscription" product
   - Add pricing:
     - Monthly: $9.99/month (recurring)
     - Lifetime: $99 (one-time)

2. **Update Price IDs in Code**:
   - Replace test price IDs with live price IDs in:
     - `src/pages/Pricing.tsx`
     - `src/components/payments/UserPaymentStatus.tsx`

### Step 4: Deploy to Production

1. **Deploy Supabase Functions**:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy create-checkout-session --project-ref your-project-ref
   supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook --project-ref your-project-ref
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   ```

### Step 5: Final Testing

1. **Test with Real Card** (small amount):
   - Use a real credit card with a small amount
   - Verify payment processes correctly
   - Check user is marked as authorized
   - Verify webhook events are received

2. **Test Subscription Flow**:
   - Create a subscription
   - Verify recurring billing works
   - Test subscription cancellation

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Database Verification
```sql
-- Check if payment fields exist
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'profiles' 
AND column_name IN ('stripe_customer_id', 'is_authorized', 'subscription_status');

-- Check indexes
SELECT indexname, indexdef 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'profiles' 
AND indexname LIKE '%stripe%' OR indexname LIKE '%authorized%';
```

### 2. Function Verification
- [ ] `create-checkout-session` function responds correctly
- [ ] `stripe-webhook` function processes events
- [ ] No errors in Supabase function logs

### 3. Frontend Verification
- [ ] Payment buttons render correctly
- [ ] Checkout flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Success/cancel pages display properly
- [ ] User payment status updates in real-time

### 4. Stripe Dashboard Verification
- [ ] Webhook events are being received
- [ ] No failed webhook deliveries
- [ ] Test payments appear in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Customer records are created

## üö® Rollback Plan

If issues occur during deployment:

1. **Revert Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Switch back to test keys
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   ```

2. **Revert Supabase Secrets**:
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_test_...
   ```

3. **Redeploy Functions**:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy create-checkout-session --project-ref your-project-ref
   supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook --project-ref your-project-ref
   ```

4. **Redeploy Frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Redeploy to hosting platform
   ```
