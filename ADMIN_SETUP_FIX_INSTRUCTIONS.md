# Admin Setup Fix Instructions

## Issues Identified and Fixed

The console errors you're seeing are caused by several issues in the admin setup process:

### 1. Missing Database Function
- **Error**: `Could not find the function public.complete_super_admin_setup`
- **Fix**: Added the missing `complete_super_admin_setup` function to the database

### 2. Permission Denied Errors
- **Error**: `permission denied for schema public`
- **Fix**: Updated RLS policies to allow admin setup process to access necessary tables

### 3. Authentication Issues
- **Error**: `401 Unauthorized` responses
- **Fix**: Fixed import issues in the frontend code and improved error handling

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Option 1: Run SQL Script in Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/fix-admin-setup.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the script
5. Verify the success message appears

### Option 2: Use the Node.js Script

1. Make sure you have the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in your `.env` file
2. Run: `node scripts/fix-admin-setup.js`

### Option 3: Manual Database Migration

1. Apply the migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250101000006_fix_admin_setup_issues.sql`
2. Use your preferred method to run the migration

## What the Fixes Do

### 1. Database Function Added
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.complete_super_admin_setup(
  p_user_id UUID,
  p_full_name TEXT
) RETURNS JSONB
```
This function:
- Checks if a super admin already exists
- Updates the user's profile with their full name
- Promotes the user to super_admin role
- Logs the admin setup completion

### 2. RLS Policies Fixed
- **Roles Table**: Added policies to allow admin setup process to check for existing super admins
- **Profiles Table**: Added policies to allow profile updates during initial setup
- **Admin Setup Check**: Added special policies that work even when no super admin exists

### 3. Frontend Code Fixed
- Fixed import issues in `AdminSetup.tsx`
- Corrected class name references
- Improved error handling

## Verification Steps

After applying the fixes:

1. **Check Database Functions**:
   ```sql
   SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
   WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
   AND routine_name = 'complete_super_admin_setup';
   ```

2. **Check Admin Setup Status**:
   ```sql
   SELECT public.get_admin_setup_status();
   ```

3. **Test the Admin Setup Process**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/setup` in your application
   - Try creating a new admin user
   - Check the browser console for errors

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- ✅ No more "function not found" errors
- ✅ No more "permission denied" errors
- ✅ Admin setup process should complete successfully
- ✅ First super admin user should be created properly

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure your Supabase URL and keys are correct
2. **Verify Database Connection**: Test the connection in your Supabase dashboard
3. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any remaining JavaScript errors
4. **Review RLS Policies**: Ensure the policies were applied correctly
