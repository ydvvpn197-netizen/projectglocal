# Profile Functionality Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve issues with the edit profile button and create post button functionality, making the user profile dynamic and fully functional.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Edit Profile Button Not Working
**Problem**: The edit profile button was not actually updating the user's profile data in the database.

**Solution**: 
- Created a complete user profile service (`src/services/userProfileService.ts`)
- Implemented proper profile update functionality with database integration
- Added real-time form validation and error handling
- Integrated with Supabase for persistent data storage

### 2. Create Post Button Not Working
**Problem**: The create post button on the user profile was not navigating to the post creation page.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the create post button to properly navigate to `/create` route
- Added proper click handlers and navigation logic
- Ensured the button works from all profile sections (Posts, Badges, etc.)

### 3. Static Profile Data
**Problem**: The profile was using hardcoded sample data instead of real user information.

**Solution**:
- Replaced all static data with dynamic data from the database
- Created comprehensive user profile service with multiple data fetching methods
- Implemented real-time data updates and refresh functionality

## New Files Created

### 1. User Profile Service (`src/services/userProfileService.ts`)
A comprehensive service class that handles all profile-related operations:

**Features**:
- User profile fetching and updating
- User statistics calculation (posts, events, followers, etc.)
- User posts retrieval
- User bookings management (events and artist bookings)
- User communities and badges
- Avatar upload functionality
- Real-time data formatting and processing

**Key Methods**:
- `getUserProfile()` - Fetch user profile data
- `updateUserProfile()` - Update profile information
- `getUserStats()` - Calculate user statistics
- `getUserPosts()` - Fetch user's posts
- `getUserBookings()` - Fetch user's bookings
- `uploadAvatar()` - Handle avatar uploads

### 2. User Profile Hook (`src/hooks/useUserProfile.tsx`)
A custom React hook that provides easy access to profile functionality:

**Features**:
- State management for all profile data
- Loading and error states
- Automatic data refresh
- Optimized data fetching
- Toast notifications for user feedback

**Key Functions**:
- `updateProfile()` - Update profile with validation
- `uploadAvatar()` - Upload profile picture
- `refreshAll()` - Refresh all profile data
- Individual fetch methods for different data types

## Updated Files

### 1. Profile Component (`src/pages/Profile.tsx`)
Completely rewritten to use dynamic data and proper functionality:

**Major Changes**:
- Replaced static data with dynamic data from the service
- Implemented proper edit profile modal with form validation
- Added avatar upload functionality
- Fixed create post button navigation
- Added loading states and error handling
- Implemented proper data refresh mechanisms
- Added empty states for all sections (posts, bookings, communities, badges)

**New Features**:
- Real-time profile editing
- Avatar upload with file validation
- Dynamic statistics display
- Proper navigation for create post button
- Responsive design improvements
- Better user feedback with toast notifications

## Database Integration

### Tables Used
- `profiles` - User profile information
- `posts` - User's posts
- `events` - Events created by user
- `event_attendees` - Events user is attending
- `artist_bookings` - Artist bookings
- `follows` - Follower/following relationships
- `likes` - Post likes
- `comments` - Post comments

### Data Flow
1. **Profile Data**: Fetched from `profiles` table
2. **Statistics**: Calculated from multiple tables (posts, events, follows, etc.)
3. **Posts**: Retrieved from `posts` table with proper formatting
4. **Bookings**: Combined from `event_attendees` and `artist_bookings` tables
5. **Communities**: Currently using mock data (ready for future implementation)
6. **Badges**: Dynamically generated based on user statistics
