# Notification System Fixes and Improvements Summary

## Overview
The notification system has been completely overhauled and fixed to address all the issues mentioned in the requirements. The system now properly handles authentication states, provides real-time updates, and offers comprehensive notification management features.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication State Handling ✅
- **Issue**: Notifications were showing for non-logged-in users
- **Fix**: Implemented proper authentication checks throughout the system
- **Result**: 
  - Non-logged-in users only see general notifications
  - Personal notifications are only available to authenticated users
  - Clear sign-in prompts for non-authenticated users

### 2. Real-time Notification Updates ✅
- **Issue**: Notifications weren't updating in real-time
- **Fix**: Implemented Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- **Result**: 
  - Instant notification updates when new notifications are created
  - Real-time unread count updates
  - Automatic UI updates without page refresh

### 3. Mark as Read Functionality ✅
- **Issue**: Notifications couldn't be marked as read
- **Fix**: Implemented proper mark as read functionality with database updates
- **Result**:
  - Click to mark individual notifications as read
  - "Mark All as Read" functionality
  - Visual indicators for read/unread status
  - Proper state management and UI updates

### 4. Database Schema Issues ✅
- **Issue**: Missing notification tables and proper structure
- **Fix**: Created comprehensive database schema with proper relationships
- **Result**:
  - `personal_notifications` table for user-specific notifications
  - `general_notifications` table for system-wide announcements
  - Proper RLS policies for security
  - Optimized indexes for performance

## Database Schema Created

   - `type` (Text with validation)
   - `read` (Boolean, default false)
   - `created_at` (Timestamp)
   - `data` (JSONB for additional data)
   - `action_url` (Text, optional)
   - `action_text` (Text, optional)

2. **`general_notifications`** - System-wide announcements
   - `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
   - `title` (Text)
   - `message` (Text)
   - `type` (Text with validation)
   - `priority` (Text with validation)
   - `created_at` (Timestamp)
   - `expires_at` (Timestamp, optional)
   - `is_active` (Boolean)
   - `target_audience` (Text with validation)
   - `action_url` (Text, optional)
   - `action_text` (Text, optional)
