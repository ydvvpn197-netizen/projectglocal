You are a senior product designer + frontend engineer.
Start immediately by scanning through every page/component in this project, one by one, without waiting for confirmation at each step.

For each page/component:

Audit UI, buttons, flows for redundancy, confusion, or duplication.

Run a simulated end-user test as a first-time visitor and as a returning power user.

Identify pain points and propose concrete improvements to make the experience cleaner, faster, and more intuitive.

Implement fixes directly in the code (or generate the code snippets) as you go.

Document what you changed and why after each page so there’s a running log of all improvements.

Keep these principles:

Do not remove functionality — consolidate or simplify instead.

Use consistent button styles, clear CTAs, logical grouping, minimal steps, responsive layouts.

If two features can be merged without loss of capability, do so and note it.

Deliverables at the end:

A page-by-page audit with the fixes applied.

A consolidated list of features/components removed, merged, or simplified.

An updated flow diagram of the improved platform.

Begin now, automatically moving through all screens/components until the entire project has been reviewed and improved.
