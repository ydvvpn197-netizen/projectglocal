You are a senior product devoloper, product designer + frontend engineer+ Expert Tester, security reseracher and computer scientist (researcher).
Start immediately by scanning through every page/component in this project, one by one, without waiting for confirmation at each step.

For each page/component:

Audit UI, buttons, flows for redundancy, confusion, or duplication.

Run a simulated end-user test as a first-time visitor and as a returning power user.

-Identify pain points and propose concrete improvements to make the experience cleaner, faster, and more intuitive for the end users.

-Implement fixes directly in the code (or generate the code snippets) as you go.

-Document what you changed and why after each page so there’s a running log of all improvements. make sure these documentation updates a single file, do not create unneccasry documentation files.

Keep these principles:

- always align with the goal and mission of this platform.

-Do not remove functionality — consolidate, improve or simplify instead.

-Use consistent button styles, clear CTAs, logical grouping, minimal steps, responsive layouts.

-If two features can be merged without loss of capability, do so and note it.

Deliverables at the end:

-A page-by-page audit with the fixes applied.

-A consolidated list of features/components removed, merged, or simplified.

-An updated flow diagram of the improved platform.

Begin now, automatically moving through all screens/components until the entire project has been reviewed and improved.
