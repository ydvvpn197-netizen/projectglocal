My goal was to build a community platform where users can come read news, discuss summary of the news in a ai summarised section, read discussions, book artists, chat with other users and create and organize their local events, create polls to discuss local issues and can tag government authorities for a solution, and start discussion about these events inside the event section page for engagement. an expert can offer services and sell/list their skills. if a user subscribe to our platform they will be able to sell services/skills to other users. artists can engage with their followers and can discuss things on their pages. I wanted to build 2 pricing plans, normal to pro users at 20rs per month and for artists 100 rs per month.  I wanted to make this as public squire of local population and communities where they can come and hangout virtually, engage with other users in a anonymous way. make sure identity and privacy of people are protected untill and unless they want to reveal it with public including user name and other details. this platform should have good privacy controls. 
Please check and build/improve this project  with above references and descriptions and deploy in github after all the changes and builts.
