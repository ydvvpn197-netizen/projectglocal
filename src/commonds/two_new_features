You are tasked with extending the existing application by adding two new features while keeping all current functionality intact. Implement them in a modular, scalable, and non-breaking way.
👉 You must think and act as a Product Manager (value + journey), Developer (architecture + scalability), and End User (trust + simplicity) while building. Deliver a production-ready implementation of both features without breaking the current app.

Feature 1: AI Legal Assistant

Goal: Allow users to ask legal questions and generate professional drafts/opinions.

Requirements:

Provide two input options:

Chatbox (real-time conversation).

Structured form (for specific document requests like rental agreements, contracts, etc.).

Backend should:

Use an LLM pipeline with references to authentic sources (legal papers, public datasets, or APIs).

Produce a reviewable draft (shown in preview/markdown).

On user confirmation → generate final draft in Word (.docx) and PDF (.pdf) formats.

Attach disclaimers to every output (“Not a substitute for licensed legal advice”).

Must store chat history and drafts for later review.

Ensure sensitive data is anonymized and securely logged.

Build this as a separate, modular service so future integrations (case law APIs, Indian Bare Acts DB, etc.) can be added.

Feature 2: Life Wish – “What I Want to Be Remembered As”

Goal: Let users write a personal note about their legacy.

Requirements:

Create a new Life Wish section in user profile.

User can write a freeform note (e.g., “I want to be remembered as someone who brought joy to others”).

Users choose visibility:

Public → shown on profile / community memorial space.

Private → stored securely, visible only to them or designated family.

Features must include create, edit, update, and delete options.

Stretch goal: allow multiple wishes (timeline/journal style).

Technical must-haves:

Encrypt notes and store them securely.

UI should feel emotional, respectful, and minimalistic (like a digital memory book, not just a form).

Add optional sharing (with explicit consent).

General Build Guidance

Do not overwrite or break any existing feature. Build these as new modules/components.

Follow clean frontend/backend separation.

Deliverables:

UI components → chatbox, forms, Life Wish editor.

Backend APIs → draft generation, PDF/Word export, Life Wish storage.

Security → encryption for private notes, safe handling of legal data.

Storage → database schema updates for drafts and Life Wishes.

User Experience Goals:

AI Legal Assistant → professional, supportive, reliable.

Life Wish → emotional, safe, personal, and privacy-first.
