# Database Errors Fixed

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing `community_groups` table**: The error `relation "public.community_groups" does not exist` indicates that the database migration for community features hasn't been applied.

2. **Incorrect route navigation**: The Community page was trying to navigate to `/create-discussion` instead of `/community/create-discussion`.

3. **TypeScript type mismatches**: The code was trying to use tables that don't exist in the current database schema.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Route Navigation
- Updated `src/pages/Community.tsx` to use correct route `/community/create-discussion` instead of `/create-discussion`
- This fixes the 404 error when users try to access the create discussion page

### 2. Updated Database Schema References
- Updated `src/pages/CreateDiscussion.tsx` to use `community_groups` table instead of `groups`
- Updated `src/hooks/useDiscussions.tsx` to use `community_posts` table instead of `discussions`

### 3. Created Database Migration Script
- Created `fix_database_errors.sql` with all necessary tables and functions
- This script can be run manually in the Supabase SQL Editor

## Required Actions

### For Database Fix:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix_database_errors.sql`
4. Run the script to create the missing tables and functions

### For TypeScript Types:
After running the database migration, regenerate the TypeScript types:
```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id your-project-id > src/types/database.types.ts
```

## Tables Created

1. **community_groups**: For managing community groups
2. **group_members**: For tracking group membership
3. **community_posts**: For storing community posts/discussions

## Functions Created

1. **get_trending_groups**: Returns trending community groups
2. **update_updated_at_column**: Updates timestamp columns automatically

## Sample Data

The migration includes sample community groups for testing:
- Local Artists Network
- Tech Enthusiasts  
- Food Lovers

## Next Steps

1. Run the database migration script
2. Regenerate TypeScript types
3. Test the community features
4. Verify that the trending groups API works correctly

## Verification

After applying the fixes, you should see:
- No more 404 errors for `/create-discussion`
- No more database errors about missing `community_groups` table
- Community features working properly
- Trending groups loading successfully
