# Account Deletion Feature

This document describes the implementation of the user account deletion feature in the Local Social Hub platform.

## Overview

The account deletion feature allows users to permanently delete their accounts and all associated data from the platform. This is implemented with proper security measures, confirmation steps, and comprehensive data cleanup.

## Features

### Frontend Implementation

1. **Settings Page Integration**
   - Located in `src/pages/Settings.tsx`
   - Added to the "Security" tab under "Danger Zone"
   - Uses AlertDialog for confirmation

2. **Confirmation Process**
   - Users must type "DELETE" to confirm
   - Clear warning about irreversible action
   - Lists all data that will be deleted

3. **Custom Hook**
   - `src/hooks/useAccountDeletion.tsx`
   - Handles the deletion API call
   - Manages loading states and error handling

### Backend Implementation

1. **Supabase Edge Function**
   - `supabase/functions/delete-user-account/index.ts`
   - Handles authentication and authorization
   - Calls database function for data cleanup
   - Deletes user from Supabase Auth

2. **Database Function**
   - `supabase/migrations/20250820000000_add_delete_user_account_function.sql`
   - Comprehensive data cleanup in correct order
   - Respects foreign key constraints
   - Uses SECURITY DEFINER for proper permissions

## Data Cleanup Order

The deletion process removes data in the following order to respect foreign key constraints:

1. **Chat Messages** - Delete messages from user's conversations
2. **Chat Conversations** - Delete all user's chat conversations
3. **Notifications** - Delete all user's notifications
4. **Artist Bookings** - Delete bookings where user is client or artist
5. **Artist Discussions** - Delete discussions created by user as artist
6. **Artists Record** - Delete user's artist profile
7. **Comments** - Delete all user's comments
8. **Likes** - Delete all user's likes
9. **Follows** - Delete all user's follow relationships
10. **Posts** - Delete all user's posts
11. **Events** - Delete events created by user
12. **Groups** - Delete groups created by user
13. **Discussions** - Delete discussions created by user
14. **Profile** - Finally delete the user's profile

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**
   - Only authenticated users can delete their accounts
   - Edge function validates user authentication

2. **Confirmation Required**
   - Users must type "DELETE" to confirm
   - Clear warning about irreversible action

3. **Data Privacy**
   - All user data is permanently deleted
   - No data retention after deletion

4. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
   - Graceful failure with clear error messages

## User Experience

### Confirmation Dialog
- Clear warning about irreversible action
- Lists all data that will be deleted
- Requires typing "DELETE" to confirm
- Cancel option available

### Loading States
- Button shows "Deleting..." during process
- Disabled state prevents multiple submissions
- Clear success/error feedback

### Post-Deletion
- User is automatically signed out
- Success message displayed
- Redirected to home page

## Implementation Files

### Frontend
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx` - Main settings page with deletion option
- `src/hooks/useAccountDeletion.tsx` - Custom hook for deletion logic
- `src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx` - Alert dialog component

### Backend
- `supabase/functions/delete-user-account/index.ts` - Edge function
- `supabase/migrations/20250820000000_add_delete_user_account_function.sql` - Database function

## Usage

1. Navigate to Settings → Security tab
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Delete Account" button
4. Read the warning and data deletion list
5. Type "DELETE" in the confirmation field
6. Click "Delete Account" to confirm
7. Wait for deletion to complete
8. User will be signed out automatically

## Error Handling

The feature includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Network Errors** - Clear error messages for connection issues
- **Authentication Errors** - Handles expired sessions
- **Database Errors** - Graceful handling of database failures
- **Validation Errors** - Clear feedback for invalid confirmations

## Testing

To test the account deletion feature:

1. Create a test account
2. Add some data (posts, comments, follows, etc.)
3. Navigate to Settings → Security
4. Test the confirmation process
5. Verify all data is deleted
6. Confirm user is signed out

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication** - Only authenticated users can delete accounts
2. **Authorization** - Users can only delete their own accounts
3. **Data Cleanup** - All related data is properly deleted
4. **Audit Trail** - Consider logging deletion events for security
5. **Rate Limiting** - Edge function includes rate limiting protection

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the account deletion feature:

1. **Data Export** - Allow users to export their data before deletion
2. **Scheduled Deletion** - Allow users to schedule deletion for later
3. **Partial Deletion** - Allow deletion of specific data types
4. **Recovery Period** - Temporary recovery window after deletion
5. **Admin Override** - Admin ability to restore deleted accounts

## Deployment Notes

1. Deploy the database migration first
2. Deploy the Edge Function
3. Update frontend code
4. Test thoroughly in staging environment
5. Monitor for any issues after deployment

## Support

For issues with the account deletion feature:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase Edge Function logs
3. Check database function execution
4. Ensure proper authentication
5. Verify all dependencies are deployed
