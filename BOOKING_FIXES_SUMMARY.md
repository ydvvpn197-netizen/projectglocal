# Booking Functionality Fixes and Improvements

## Issue Fixed
The main issue was a `ReferenceError: notificationError is not defined` error occurring in the `BookingRequestsPanel.tsx` file when clicking Accept/Reject buttons on artist booking requests.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by a variable scope issue where `notificationError` was referenced outside of its try-catch block scope in the `handleBookingAction` function.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed BookingRequestsPanel.tsx
**File:** `src/components/BookingRequestsPanel.tsx`
**Issue:** `notificationError` variable scope error
**Fix:** Removed the redundant `if (notificationError)` check that was outside the try-catch block

```typescript
// Before (causing error):
try {
  await notificationService.createBookingResponseNotification(requestId, action);
} catch (notificationError) {
  console.error('Error creating booking response notification:', notificationError);
}

if (notificationError) { // ‚ùå Error: notificationError not defined
  console.error('Error creating notification:', notificationError);
}

// After (fixed):
try {
  await notificationService.createBookingResponseNotification(requestId, action);
} catch (notificationError) {
  console.error('Error creating booking response notification:', notificationError);
  // Don't fail the booking action if notification fails
}
```

### 2. Created ClientBookingsPanel.tsx
**File:** `src/components/ClientBookingsPanel.tsx`
**Purpose:** New component for regular users to view and manage their booking requests
**Features:**
- View all booking requests with status indicators
- Real-time updates when booking status changes
- Detailed booking information in modal dialogs
- Status-based actions (chat with artist for accepted bookings)
- Responsive design with proper loading states

### 3. Created UserDashboard.tsx
**File:** `src/pages/UserDashboard.tsx`
**Purpose:** New dashboard page for regular users
**Features:**
- Booking statistics overview
- Quick action cards for common tasks
- Tabbed interface for bookings, profile, and settings
- Integration with ClientBookingsPanel
- User profile information display

### 4. Updated App.tsx Routing
**File:** `src/App.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Added import for UserDashboard component
- Added route `/user-dashboard` for the new user dashboard

### 5. Enhanced AppSidebar.tsx
**File:** `src/components/AppSidebar.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Added user type detection (artist vs regular user)
- Dynamic navigation items based on user type
- Artists see "Artist Dashboard" link
- Regular users see "My Dashboard" link
- Added proper imports for useState, useEffect, and supabase

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:

## Notification System

The booking system integrates with the existing notification service:
- Booking request notifications for artists
