# Deployment Fixes Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SPA Routing Issues
- **Problem**: Links and buttons showing "something went wrong" errors
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect SPA routing configuration
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed `_redirects` files for Netlify/GitHub Pages
  - Updated `vercel.json` for Vercel deployment
  - Improved error handling for routing issues

### 2. Environment Configuration Issues
- **Problem**: Build failures due to missing environment variables
- **Root Cause**: Strict validation throwing errors during build
- **Solution**:
  - Made environment validation more graceful
  - Added fallback values for missing environment variables
  - Only throw errors in development mode

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- **Problem**: Generic error messages not helpful for debugging
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced ErrorBoundary with specific error type detection
  - Added routing error detection and handling
  - Improved error messages and recovery options

## Files Modified

### Core Configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Fixed base URL configuration
- `src/config/environment.ts` - Made environment validation more graceful
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - Added fallback values

### Error Handling
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Enhanced error detection and recovery

### Deployment Configuration
- `vercel.json` - Improved routing rules
- `public/_redirects` - Ensured correct SPA routing
- `dist/_redirects` - Ensured correct SPA routing

### New Files
- `scripts/deploy-fix.js` - Deployment fix script
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES_GUIDE.md` - This guide

## Deployment Instructions

### For Vercel
1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. Deploy using `npm run deploy:vercel` or push to GitHub
3. Vercel will automatically use the `vercel.json` configuration

### For Netlify
1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to Netlify
3. The `_redirects` file will handle SPA routing

### For GitHub Pages
1. Run `npm run deploy:github`
2. This will build and deploy to GitHub Pages automatically

### For Other Platforms
1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. Deploy the `dist` folder
3. Ensure your platform supports SPA routing (redirect all routes to index.html)

## Testing the Fixes

### Local Testing
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Test the build locally
npm run preview

# Run deployment fixes
npm run deploy:fix
```

### Production Testing
1. Deploy to your platform
2. Test navigation between pages
3. Test direct URL access (e.g., `/feed`, `/profile`)
4. Test error scenarios

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Something went wrong" still appears
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Check network connectivity to Supabase

### Issue: Pages not loading on direct access
**Solution**: 
1. Verify `_redirects` file is in the root of your deployment
2. Check that your hosting platform supports SPA routing
3. Ensure all routes redirect to `index.html`

### Issue: Build failures
**Solution**: 
1. Run `npm run deploy:fix` to fix common issues
2. Check that all required environment variables are set
3. Clear node_modules and reinstall: `npm run reinstall`

## Environment Variables Required

### Required (for basic functionality)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Optional (for enhanced features)
- `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - For location services
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - For payments
- `VITE_NEWS_API_KEY` - For news feed

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Error Tracking
- Errors are logged to browser console
- ErrorBoundary provides user-friendly error messages
- Specific error types are detected and handled

### Performance Monitoring
- Enable performance monitoring in environment variables
- Use browser dev tools to monitor network requests
- Check Supabase connection status

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your environment variables are correct
3. Test with a fresh build: `npm run clean && npm run build`
4. Check your hosting platform's SPA routing configuration

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the fixes to your production environment
2. Test all major user flows
3. Monitor error logs for any remaining issues
4. Consider implementing error tracking service for production monitoring
