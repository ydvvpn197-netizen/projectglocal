# TheGlocal Database Setup Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for setting up the complete database schema for TheGlocal project with all features including authentication, content management, news system, monetization, and community features.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Supabase project set up
- Supabase CLI installed
- Access to your Supabase project

### 1. Run Database Migrations

Run the following migrations in order:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-project-directory

# Run migrations in order
supabase db reset
supabase migration up
```

Or run the migrations manually in your Supabase dashboard:

1. `20250101000001_complete_database_schema.sql`
2. `20250101000002_database_functions_and_triggers.sql`
3. `20250101000003_row_level_security_policies.sql`
4. `20250101000004_initial_data_and_setup.sql`
5. `20250101000005_admin_setup_and_auth_config.sql`

### 2. Verify Setup

Run the verification script:

```sql
-- Check system health
SELECT public.get_system_health();

-- Verify admin setup
SELECT public.verify_admin_setup();

-- Check database setup
SELECT public.verify_database_setup();
```

### 3. Create Super Admin

1. Create your first user account through the application
2. Use the admin setup page to promote the user to super admin
3. Verify the setup is complete

## üîê Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled with comprehensive policies:

- **Users** can only access their own data
- **Admins** can manage content and users
- **Super Admins** have full system access
- **Public** access for appropriate content (posts, news, etc.)

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Four user roles with hierarchical permissions:

1. **`user`** - Basic user permissions
2. **`moderator`** - Content moderation permissions
3. **`admin`** - Administrative permissions
4. **`super_admin`** - Full system access

### Security Functions
- `is_authenticated()` - Check if user is logged in
- `is_admin()` - Check if user is admin or super admin
- `is_super_admin()` - Check if user is super admin
- `has_permission()` - Check specific permissions

- Performance monitoring

## üö® Important Security Notes

### Super Admin Protection
- Only super admins can delete tables/schemas
- Last super admin cannot be demoted
- Super admin actions are logged
- Database structure changes require super admin privileges

### Data Protection
- All user data is protected by RLS
- Sensitive operations are logged
- Payment data is encrypted
- User behavior data is anonymized

### Best Practices
- Use service role key only in backend
- Never expose admin functions to frontend
- Regularly review audit logs
- Monitor system health

## üß™ Testing

### Test Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the fresh database setup script
\i scripts/fresh-database-setup.sql

-- Verify all features work
SELECT public.get_system_health();
```

### Test User Creation
1. Create a test user through the application
2. Verify profile and role creation
3. Test user permissions
4. Test admin functions

### Test Features
- User registration and authentication
- Content creation and management
- News system functionality
- Payment processing
- Community features
- Admin dashboard

## üìù Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance
```sql
-- Run maintenance (cleanup expired data)
SELECT public.run_maintenance();

-- Update leaderboard ranks
SELECT public.refresh_all_leaderboard_ranks();

-- Check system health
SELECT public.get_system_health();
```

### Monitoring
- Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity
- Check system health regularly
- Review user activity and engagement
- Monitor payment processing

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Migration Errors
- Ensure migrations run in order
- Check for existing tables/conflicts
