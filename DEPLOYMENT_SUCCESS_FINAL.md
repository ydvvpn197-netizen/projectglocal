## 📊 Deployment Architecture

```
User Request → DNS (theglocal.in) → GitHub Pages → Static Files (dist/)
                                                      ↓
                                              React App + Supabase Backend
```

### **Key Components Working**:
- ✅ **Frontend**: React SPA with Vite build system
- ✅ **Backend**: Supabase (database, auth, real-time)
- ✅ **Hosting**: GitHub Pages with custom domain
- ✅ **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions automated deployment
- ✅ **Security**: HTTPS, CSP headers, secure headers
