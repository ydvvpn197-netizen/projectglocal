# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Vite Configuration Issue**
**Problem**: The Vite config was using a static base URL `'./'` which caused asset paths to be incorrect for GitHub Pages with custom domain.

**Fix**: Updated `vite.config.ts` to use dynamic base URL:
```typescript
base: mode === 'production' ? './' : '/',
```

This ensures:
- Production builds use relative paths (`./`) for GitHub Pages
- Development builds use absolute paths (`/`) for local development

### 2. **Asset Path Issues**
**Problem**: Built HTML was referencing assets with `/projectglocal/` prefix, which doesn't work with custom domains.

**Fix**: The Vite config change automatically fixes this by generating relative paths like:
- `./js/index-CXKTGO-G.js` instead of `/projectglocal/js/index-CXKTGO-G.js`

### 3. **GitHub Actions Workflow Enhancement**
**Problem**: CNAME file wasn't being explicitly created during deployment.

**Fix**: Added explicit CNAME creation step in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Create CNAME file
  run: echo "theglocal.in" > dist/CNAME
```

## Current Configuration Status

### âœ… Working Components:
1. **Custom Domain**: `theglocal.in` is properly configured in GitHub Pages settings
2. **DNS Check**: Shows "DNS check successful" 
3. **HTTPS**: Enforced and working
4. **CNAME File**: Properly created in both `public/` and `dist/` directories
5. **SPA Routing**: 404.html configured for React Router
6. **Build Process**: Local build working correctly

### ðŸ”„ Deployment Process:
1. **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch or manual workflow dispatch
2. **Build**: Uses `npm run build:prod` (Vite production build)
3. **Artifact**: Uploads `dist/` directory to GitHub Pages
4. **Deploy**: Uses GitHub Pages deployment action

## Monitoring Deployment

### 1. **Check GitHub Actions**
- Go to: `https://github.com/ydvvpn197-netizen/projectglocal/actions`
- Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- Monitor the latest run for success/failure

### 2. **Check GitHub Pages Settings**
- Go to: `https://github.com/ydvvpn197-netizen/projectglocal/settings/pages`
- Verify custom domain is set to `theglocal.in`
- Check that "DNS check successful" is shown

### 3. **Test Domain**
- Visit: `https://theglocal.in`
- Should load your React application
- Check browser console for any errors

## Expected Timeline

- **Deployment Time**: 2-5 minutes after push
- **DNS Propagation**: Usually immediate (since already configured)
- **HTTPS**: Automatic via GitHub Pages

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Ensure build script `build:prod` exists and works locally

### If domain doesn't load:
1. Verify DNS settings point to GitHub Pages
2. Check that CNAME file contains `theglocal.in`
3. Wait a few minutes for propagation

### If assets don't load:
1. Check that Vite config uses relative paths in production
2. Verify all assets are in the `dist/` directory
3. Check browser console for 404 errors

## Files Modified

1. **`vite.config.ts`**: Updated base URL configuration
2. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**: Added CNAME creation step
3. **`public/CNAME`**: Already existed, contains `theglocal.in`

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Watch the GitHub Actions workflow for successful deployment
2. **Test**: Visit `https://theglocal.in` once deployment completes
3. **Verify**: Check that all features work correctly on the live site
4. **Optimize**: Consider adding caching headers and performance optimizations

## Success Indicators

âœ… **Deployment Success**:
- GitHub Actions workflow shows green checkmark
- No build errors in logs
- All assets uploaded successfully

âœ… **Domain Working**:
- `https://theglocal.in` loads your application
- No console errors
- All features functional
- HTTPS working properly

âœ… **SPA Routing**:
- Direct URLs work (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/events`)
- Browser back/forward buttons work
- No 404 errors on route changes
