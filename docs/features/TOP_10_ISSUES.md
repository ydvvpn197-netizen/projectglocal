# Top 10 High-Priority Issues - TheGlocal.in

## Executive Summary
After comprehensive analysis of the codebase, database schema, and component structure, here are the critical issues that need immediate attention to make the project production-ready.

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE #1: Anonymous-by-Default Not Enforced**
**Priority: P0 - BLOCKING**
- **Problem**: Users can see real names throughout the app despite privacy-first vision
- **Evidence**: 
  - `AuthProvider.tsx` creates profiles with real names by default
  - Anonymous handle system exists but isn't enforced in UI components
  - Privacy settings not properly integrated
- **Impact**: Violates core privacy-first principle
- **Fix Required**: Enforce anonymous display names everywhere, update all user-facing components

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE #2: Database Schema Inconsistencies**
**Priority: P0 - BLOCKING**
- **Problem**: Missing tables and inconsistent field names across migrations
- **Evidence**:
  - Anonymous handle fields exist in migration but not in core schema
  - Missing `privacy_settings` table referenced in code
  - `artists` table referenced but not defined in core schema
  - Inconsistent snake_case vs camelCase in database vs TypeScript types
- **Impact**: Runtime errors, data integrity issues
- **Fix Required**: Complete database schema consolidation and migration

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE #3: Duplicate Services and Components**
**Priority: P1 - HIGH**
- **Problem**: Multiple implementations of same functionality
- **Evidence**:
  - 3 different news summarization services
  - Multiple chat systems (EnhancedChat, SimpleChat, ConsolidatedChat)
  - Duplicate booking systems (BookArtist, BookArtistSimple, BookArtistTest)
  - Multiple profile components (Profile, UserProfile, ConsolidatedProfile)
- **Impact**: Code bloat, maintenance nightmare, inconsistent UX
- **Fix Required**: Consolidate into single implementations

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE #4: RLS Policies Not Comprehensive**
**Priority: P0 - BLOCKING**
- **Problem**: Row Level Security gaps allow unauthorized access
- **Evidence**:
  - Some policies allow `true` (public access) where they shouldn't
  - Missing policies for new tables
  - Anonymous handle system not properly secured
  - Privacy audit logs accessible without proper restrictions
- **Impact**: Security vulnerabilities, data leaks
- **Fix Required**: Audit and fix all RLS policies

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE #5: Missing Core Features Implementation**
**Priority: P1 - HIGH**
- **Problem**: Key features referenced but not implemented
- **Evidence**:
  - Government authority tagging system incomplete
  - Virtual protest system exists but not functional
  - Community polls system partially implemented
  - Legal document generator exists but not integrated
- **Impact**: Incomplete product, poor user experience
- **Fix Required**: Complete implementation of core features

---

## ⚠️ **ISSUE #6: Performance and Bundle Size**
**Priority: P2 - MEDIUM**
- **Problem**: Large bundle size and performance issues
- **Evidence**:
  - 375+ components in src/components
  - 98 pages in src/pages
  - Multiple large dependencies
  - No proper code splitting for mobile
- **Impact**: Slow load times, poor mobile experience
- **Fix Required**: Bundle optimization and lazy loading improvements

---

## ⚠️ **ISSUE #7: Inconsistent Error Handling**
**Priority: P2 - MEDIUM**
- **Problem**: Error handling patterns vary across components
- **Evidence**:
  - Some components use try-catch, others don't
  - Inconsistent error UI patterns
  - Missing error boundaries in some routes
- **Impact**: Poor user experience during errors
- **Fix Required**: Standardize error handling patterns

---

## ⚠️ **ISSUE #8: Mobile Experience Gaps**
**Priority: P2 - MEDIUM**
- **Problem**: Mobile layout inconsistencies
- **Evidence**:
  - Some components not mobile-optimized
  - Touch interactions not properly handled
  - Mobile navigation incomplete
- **Impact**: Poor mobile user experience
- **Fix Required**: Complete mobile optimization

---

## ⚠️ **ISSUE #9: Type Safety Issues**
**Priority: P2 - MEDIUM**
- **Problem**: TypeScript types not properly aligned
- **Evidence**:
  - Database types (snake_case) vs TypeScript types (camelCase)
  - Missing type definitions for new features
  - Any types used instead of proper interfaces
- **Impact**: Runtime errors, poor developer experience
- **Fix Required**: Align types and add proper interfaces

---

## ⚠️ **ISSUE #10: Testing Coverage Gaps**
**Priority: P3 - LOW**
- **Problem**: Insufficient test coverage for critical paths
- **Evidence**:
  - Only 20 test files for 375+ components
  - Missing integration tests for auth flow
  - No tests for privacy features
- **Impact**: Bugs in production, regression risks
- **Fix Required**: Add comprehensive test coverage

---
