# Domain Deployment Guide for theglocal.in

## üöÄ Quick Deployment

Your project is now configured for domain deployment. Here's what you need to do:

### 1. Build and Deploy
```bash
npm run deploy:domain
```

This will create a deployment package: `theglocal-domain-deploy.zip`

### 2. Upload to Web Server
Upload the contents of the `dist/` folder to your web server's root directory.

### 3. DNS Configuration (GoDaddy)

Since you bought the domain from GoDaddy, you need to configure DNS:

#### A. Log into GoDaddy
1. Go to [GoDaddy.com](https://godaddy.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Go to "My Products" ‚Üí "Domains"

#### B. Configure DNS Records
1. Click on `theglocal.in`
2. Go to "DNS" tab
3. Add/Update these records:

**A Record:**
- Name: `@` (or leave blank)
- Value: Your web server's IP address
- TTL: 600 (or default)

**CNAME Record:**
- Name: `www`
- Value: `theglocal.in`
- TTL: 600 (or default)

### 4. SSL Certificate
Install an SSL certificate for `https://theglocal.in`:
