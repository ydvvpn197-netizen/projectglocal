# 🎉 GitHub Pages Setup Complete for theglocal.in

## ✅ What I've Fixed

Your project is now properly configured for GitHub Pages deployment. Here's what I've done:

### 1. **Fixed Vite Configuration**
- ✅ Updated `vite.config.ts` to use relative paths for GitHub Pages
- ✅ Configured base URL to work with GitHub Pages
- ✅ Updated CSP to allow domain connections

### 2. **Created GitHub Actions Workflow**
- ✅ Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for automatic deployment
- ✅ Configured to build and deploy on every push to main branch
- ✅ Set up proper Node.js environment and caching

### 3. **Added GitHub Pages SPA Routing**
- ✅ Created `public/404.html` for SPA routing
- ✅ Updated `index.html` with GitHub Pages routing script
- ✅ Updated `.htaccess` for GitHub Pages compatibility

### 4. **Generated Production Build**
- ✅ Built project with GitHub Pages configuration
- ✅ All assets now use relative paths
- ✅ SPA routing properly configured

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### **Step 1: Commit and Push Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Enable GitHub Actions**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. You should see the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow" if it doesn't start automatically

### **Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages Source**
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Scroll down to "Pages" section
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "gh-pages" branch (created by GitHub Actions)
5. Click "Save"

### **Step 4: Verify Deployment**
1. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete (check Actions tab)
2. Your site will be available at: `https://theglocal.in`
3. Test all functionality and routing

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Current Configuration**
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Domain**: `https://theglocal.in`
- **Build**: Automatic via GitHub Actions
- **Routing**: SPA routing with 404.html fallback
- **SSL**: Automatic HTTPS (enforced)

### **Files Created/Modified**
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ `public/404.html` - SPA routing for GitHub Pages
- ✅ `index.html` - Updated with routing script
- ✅ `vite.config.ts` - Updated for GitHub Pages
- ✅ `public/.htaccess` - Updated for GitHub Pages

### **GitHub Actions Workflow**
The workflow will:
1. Checkout your code
2. Setup Node.js 18
3. Install dependencies
4. Build the project
5. Deploy to `gh-pages` branch

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If GitHub Actions fails:**
1. Check the Actions tab for error details
2. Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`

### **If site doesn't load:**
1. Check if `gh-pages` branch was created
2. Verify GitHub Pages source is set to `gh-pages` branch
3. Wait for DNS propagation (can take a few minutes)

### **If routing doesn't work:**
1. Ensure `404.html` is in the root of `gh-pages` branch
2. Check that the routing script is in `index.html`
3. Test direct URLs like `https://theglocal.in/about`
